# Smart Robotics Course Project
 
Tools and languages used: CoppeliaSim, Lua, Python, OpenCV, NumPy, OMPL, Ruckig

The idea: object quality check for small industrial contexts: shape and mass evaluation of small objects with motion planning and collision avoidance.
Main goal: our robot should be aware of the context in which it operates and of the objects that it handles to perform its industrial work.
Key parts: 
● computer vision algorithm for object shape detection
● mass evaluation by a force sensor
● motion path planning with collision avoidance
